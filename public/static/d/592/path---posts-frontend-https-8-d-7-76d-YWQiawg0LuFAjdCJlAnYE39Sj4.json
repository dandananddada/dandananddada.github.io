{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>What is https</h3>\n<p>HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a protocol for securing the communication between two systems e.g. the browser and the web server.</p>\n<p>HTTPS established an encrypted link between the browser and the web server using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. TLS is the new version of SSL.</p>\n<h3>How SSL works</h3>\n<p>SSL fundamentally works with the following concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asymmetric Cryptography</li>\n<li>Symmetric Cryptography</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Asymmetric Cryptography</h4>\n<p>Asymmetric cryptography uses a mathematically-related key pair to encrypt and decrypt data. In a key pair, one key is shared with anyone who is interested in a communication. This is called Public Key. The other key in the key pair is kept secret and is called Private Key.</p>\n<p><img src=\"%E4%B8%8D%E5%AF%B9%E7%A7%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%AF%86\" alt=\"https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/Content/images/https/asymmetric-cryptography.png\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 17, 2019","path":"https","category":"frontend","title":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol"}}},"pageContext":{"location":"https","category":"frontend"}}
