{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Most HTTP responses include an entity which contains information for interpretation by a human user. Naturally, it is desirable to supply the user with the \"best available\" entity corresponding to the request. Unfortunately for servers and caches, not all users have the same preferences for what is \"best,\" and not all user agents are equally capable of rendering all entity types. For that reason, HTTP has provisions for several mechanisms for \"content negotiation\".</p>\n<p>There are two kinds of content negotiation which are possible in HTTP: <strong>server-driven</strong> and <strong>agent-driven negotiation</strong>. These two kinds of negotiation are orthogonal and thus may be used separately or in combination. </p>\n<h3>Server-driven Negotiation</h3>\n<p>If the selection of the best representation for a response is made by an algorithm located at the server, it is called server-driven negotiation.</p>\n<p>HTTP/1.1 includes the following request-header fields for enabling server-driven negotiation through description of user agent capabilities and user preferences: <code class=\"language-text\">Accept</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Accept-Charset</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Accept-Encoding</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Accept-Language</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">User-Agent</code>.</p>\n<h3>Agent-driven Negotiation</h3>\n<p>With agent-driven negotiation, selection of the best representation for a response is performed by the user agent after receiving an initial response from the origin server.</p>\n<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the <code class=\"language-text\">300</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">406</code> status codes for enabling agent-driven negotiation when the server is unwilling or unable to provide a varying response using server-driven negotiation.</p>\n<h3>Transparent Negotiation</h3>\n<p>Transparent negotiation is a combination of both server-driven and agent-driven negotiation. When a cache is supplied with a form of the list of available representations of the response and the dimensions of variance are completely understood by the cache, then the cache becomes capable of performing server- driven negotiation on behalf of the origin server for subsequent requests on that resource.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 01, 2019","path":"xss","category":"frontend","title":"XSS"}}},"pageContext":{"location":"xss","category":"frontend"}}
