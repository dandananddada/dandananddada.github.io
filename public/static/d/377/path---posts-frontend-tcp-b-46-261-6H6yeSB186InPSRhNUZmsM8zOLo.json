{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The transmission control protocol (TCP) is the internet standard ensuring the successful exchange of data packets between devices over a network. TCP is the underlying communication protocol for a wide variety of applications, including web servers and websites, email applications, FTP and peer-to-peer apps.</p>\n<p>TCP operates with the internet protocol (IP) to specify how data is exchanged online. IP is responsible for sending each packet to its destination, while TCP guarantees that bytes are transmitted in the order in which they were sent with no errors or omissions. Together, the two protocols are referred to as TCP/IP.</p>\n<h4>The three-way handshake</h4>\n<p>Establishing a TCP connection requires that both the client and server participate in what is known as a three-way handshake. The process can be broken down as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A client sends the server a SYN packet—a connection request from its source port to a server’s destination port.</li>\n<li>The server responds with a SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the receipt of the connection request.</li>\n<li>The client receives the SYN/ACK packet and responds with an ACK packet of its own.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 20, 2019","path":"tcp","category":"frontend","title":"Transmission Control Protocol"}}},"pageContext":{"location":"tcp","category":"frontend"}}
