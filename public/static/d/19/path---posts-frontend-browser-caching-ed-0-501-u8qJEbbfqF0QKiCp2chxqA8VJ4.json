{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>What is Caching</h3>\n<p>Caching is the concept of intelligently storing commonly-used data in quick-to-access locations so that requesting that data will happen as fast as possible. There are multiple types of caches out there such as CPU cache, GPU cache, disc cache, etc. </p>\n<p>When a requested resource is found in cache, it’s called a <strong>cache hit</strong>. Similarly, if a resource is not found in cache and had to be fully requested from its normal location, it’s called a <strong>cache miss</strong>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 05, 2019","path":"browser-caching","category":"frontend","title":"Browser Caching"}}},"pageContext":{"location":"browser-caching","category":"frontend"}}
