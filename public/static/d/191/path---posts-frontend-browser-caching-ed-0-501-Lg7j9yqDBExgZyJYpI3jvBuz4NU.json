{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>What is Caching</h3>\n<p>Caching is the concept of intelligently storing commonly-used data in quick-to-access locations so that requesting that data will happen as fast as possible. There are multiple types of caches out there such as CPU cache, GPU cache, disc cache, etc. </p>\n<p>When a requested resource is found in cache, it’s called a <strong>cache hit</strong>. Similarly, if a resource is not found in cache and had to be fully requested from its normal location, it’s called a <strong>cache miss</strong>.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of browser caching, each browser has its own web cache, which is where resources like images and other web page assets are stored for quick access later on. The goal of browser caching is to save you time when requesting the same resource multiple times, and to save bandwidth by reducing the amount of data you request over a network.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"July 05, 2019","path":"browser-caching","category":"frontend","title":"Browser Caching"}}},"pageContext":{"location":"browser-caching","category":"frontend"}}
